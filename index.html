			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p id="description">
					 	 <img src="assets/images/biopic.png" alt name="Bio Picture" id="biopic"> Hey, my name is Neetu, and I'm a three-day web developer. I graduated from the University of Texas in Austin three years ago with a degree and Magazine Editing & Writing, as well as a degree in Corportate Communication. College was an awesome experience, but it didn't do shit to prepare me for the real world. After I graduated, all I knew was that I wanted to stay in Austin, so I took the first job I was offered. I ended up working for a small company that collects educational data and submits it to state department education agencies. One day I woke up and through, "fuck, I've been at this company for three years and feel more lost than ever." Next thing I knew, I enrolled myself into this coding bootcamp. They day before it started, I thought to myself, "fuck, I still don't know what I want to do, but I'm going to go with it. Three days in, i've realized, there's no greater elation than getting a code to work! So, at this point in my life, all I know is there are 4 things I truly love: Austin, TX, my pup, being outdoors, and seeing a code you put together show the results you actually wanted! So fuck it, let's see how this goes! </p>
