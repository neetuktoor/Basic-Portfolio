			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p id="description">
					 	 <img src="assets/images/biopic.png" alt="Bio Picture" id="biopic"> Hey there, my name is Neetu. I grew up in the suburbs of Houston and moved to Austin to start school in Austin back in 2010, and have been here since. For three years, I managed the social media and WordPress accounts for a small company that collects educational data and submits it to start department education agencies. I decided I wanted to go back to school and pick up a new skill set to better myself and further my professional career. I love the outdoors, hanging out by the river and lake, and going on adventures with my pup. I studied Magazine Journalism when I was in college and enjoy keeping up with the news and politics. I'm very new to coding, and it's definitely been an adventure. A frustrating, but rewarding adventure to say the least. I've always had a passion for learning and growing, so I'm definitely up for the challenge. I enjoy traveling and learning about other cultures, primarily because I love trying different foods! I have a lot of emotions about the challenge of learning coding in 3 months, ranging from stress, uncertainty, and excitement. I can't wait to see where i'll be in September! </p>
